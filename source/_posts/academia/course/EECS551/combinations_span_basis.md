# Combinations

```
u = \alpha{v} + \beta{w}
```
`u` is the linear combination of `v` and `w`, `\alpha` and `\beta` are scaler.

This is also means u is linearly dependent with `v` or `w`.

```
u \notequal \alpha{v}
u \notequal \alpha{v} + \beta{w}
```
This means u is linearly independent with `v` or `w`.

Definition: u, v, w are linearly independent.
```
av + bw + cu = 0
u \notequal av + bw
```



# Span

The span of `v` and `w` is the set of all their linear combinations.

For 3-Dimension

> The basis of a vector space is a set of linearly independent vectors that span the full space.


# Basis vectors

```
i = [1,0]
j = [0,1]
```

are basis vectors of the x-y coordinate system.
