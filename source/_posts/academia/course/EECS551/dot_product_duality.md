# Dot product

In similar directions `v*w > 0`

In perpendicular direction `v*w = 0`

In Opposing directions `v*w < 0`

Dot product is translate one of the vector to the transformation.

# Duality

Making a symmetric line which seperate basis vector and input vector equally.

When you try find a linear transformation to map vectors in 2-D space into number line, you will be able to match it to some vector, which is called dual vector of the transformation.
